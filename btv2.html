     <p>I have created a fragment of content. How do we use fragments of the IIIF Universe as editorial?</p>
    
     <p><a href="http://tomcrane.github.io/wellcome-today/annodump.html?manifest=https://wellcomelibrary.org/iiif/b28047345/manifest&amp;page=33">Looking at the bits of a manifest (text and images identified by annotation; C&amp;D)</a></p>

     <p>=> <a href="https://tomcrane.github.io/iiif-img-tag/">IIIF-enhanced image tags</a> - is this a viewer? Image cropping tools.</p>

     <p>But what about everything that lies between an image request and a Manifest? Use parts on static HTML web pages? Not embed a viewer. Page/mention an intellectual object that is PART of a manifest. Like the egg annotation - from the outside looking in.</p>

     
<p>In these scenarios, the manifest is the carrier, but the intellectual objects we want to focus our attention on are below the level of the manifest and not individually described. But we can look inside the manifest, and describe what we're interested in, and then use that description to generate web pages and other user experiences.</p>

<p>Another anno - <a href="https://tomcrane.github.io/iiif-collector/">bug in manuscript</a></p>

<p><a href="https://tomcrane.github.io/iiif-collector/#objects/table.json">A dataset drived from an image</a></p>

<p><a href="https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b2005127x">Maurice Wilkins. One manifest, many things. Archival description=>IIIF</a></p>

<p>Range -> <a href="https://tomcrane.github.io/iiif-collector/#objects/short-article.json">Short C&amp;D article</a></p>

<p><a href="https://tomcrane.github.io/iiif-collector/#objects/longer-article.json">A longer article</a>

<p>We preserve the natural Carrier, the manifest, while freely resuing finer structure, whether it's already described by the carrier or we have to make new descritions from outside.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomcrane.github.io/iiif-collector/#objects/chapter.json">A chapter of a book, with its illustrations</a></p>

<p>These are just my MVP-style bits of JavaScript for demonstrating the use of these resources outside of the context of a manifest in a viewer. You could have more sophisticated management and mixing. Viewer that constrains to range, masks. Alt range cropping versions of the images, using sequence behavior.</p>

<h2>Hyperlinking the archive</h2>

    <p><a href="https://galway-viewer.digirati.com/">Galway manifest</a></p>
    <p>Ranges for timeline</p>
    <p>hyperlinking - currently simple but you can imagine where this can go</p>

    <p>=> make the digitised content itself part of navigable user journeys, not just the web pages around them. </p>
    <p>annotations on the HTML content => user journeys that dip in and out of IIIF space.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Links from one part of resource to another</li>
        <li>links from one part of a resource to a point in a different IIIF resource</li>
        <li>links from IIIF to web pages</li>
        <li>links from web pages (as annos) that directly target a IIIF target</li>
    </ul>
